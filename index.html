            When working on his recent movie, all was going well. It seemed stressful at times but was that really an excuse to do what he did? Did he really have to go to such extents? I think not. But what do you think? </p></div>

            The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.</p>
